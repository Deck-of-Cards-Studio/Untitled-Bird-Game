# How to use GitHub
This document is a work in progress. Feel free to edit it.
## Common terms
* [Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#branch) - A parallel version in a repository
* Fork - A personal copy of a repository
* Pull request - Proposed changes to the repository that are ready for review
* Push - resolve a pull request, adding the changes from one branch into another
* Commit - change to a file or group of files
See the entire [glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) and other information [here](https://docs.github.com/en).
## Guidelines
* <b>Stay organized.</b> Avoid creating more new branches than necessary, don't do too much in one pull request, don't make pointless commits, and have descriptions and clear titles. Everything is easier when it's clear what we're doing.
* <b>Be civil.</b> We can all edit everything, but that isn't an excuse to mess with others' work. If you disagree with something, work it out rather than going ahead with changes.
* <b>Use pull requests to review.</b> Because everyone can edit, the function of pull requests is to ensure that the contents is ready to greet the world.
